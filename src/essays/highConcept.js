        What High Concept Films Say About America in the 1990’s
      </div>
      <p>Published on May 20, 2025 </p>
      <p>
        In the late 1940’s, the Studio System of long-term contracts with
        creatives and vertical integration of production and distribution of
        films began to collapse, setting the stage for experimentation in
        mainstream filmmaking. American films reached a creative peak in the
        1970’s, when major studios allowed filmmakers like Martin Scorsese and
        Francis Ford Coppola to make gritty films challenging myths of American
        exceptionalism. In addition, independent studios in the 70’s produced
        Blaxploitation films celebrating Black Power. Stephen Spielberg’s Jaws
        (1975) and George Lucas’s Star Wars (1977) changed all that. Studios
        learned that blockbusters conceived of and controlled by the studio, not
        by the auteur director, could generate massive profits and wrestle
        control away from creatives and back to the producers. In order to
        appeal to as broad an audience possible, throughout the 80’s and 90’s,
        mainstream films increasingly became high concept films. High concept
        films are films based on simple ideas that can be stated in a sentence.
        Whereas low-concept films feature complex character studies, high
        concept films have simple premises, high stakes and expensive visual
        spectacles. High concept films flourished in the 80’s (Back to the
        Future, RoboCop, Top Gun), and reached their highest level of
        sophistication in the 90’s. Cinephiles regard 90’s cinema highly because
        of the rise of independent film directed by auteurs such as the Coen
        Brothers and Quentin Tarantino. I would also contend that the 90’s was
        the last decade of great high concept movies. Since then, high concept
        films have come to represent corporate greed, Hollywood cynicism and
        creative bankruptcy. In the 90’s, however, high concept films had much
        more than the power to distract. Back then, they had the power of myth.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use the word myth loosely. If myths are traditional, movies cannot be
        called traditional since they are modern commodities made by artists and
        capitalists. Still, as a child of the 90’s, an atheist, and a creature
        of media that worships at the altar of pop culture, movies constitute a
        set of shared narratives that explain the fundamental values of American
        society. They are the closest modern analogue to myths, that is, when
        they are well executed and memorable. I do not think movies have the
        power of myth today, in the 2020’s. Perhaps I am a pessimist. Perhaps I
        am merely an adult. Or, perhaps competition from streaming services and
        the disappearance of the mid budget movie from theaters has lessened the
        power of films to create myths that unite American audiences.
      </p>

      <p>
        The decline of the centrality of movie-going culture has coincided with
        the decline of belief in the myths of American Empire. The pessimism of
        American pop culture and of society today is distinct from the imagined
        slackerism and cynicism of the 90’s. Of course, the 90’s were as great
        and as horrible as any other decade of the twentieth century. There was
        a lot of racial and class strife back then, but there was also a widely
        held myth about the United States that is increasingly understood today
        as a myth, and therefore false: the myth of American progress. There
        have been many challenges to the myth of American progress, such as The
        Vietnam War, Watergate, and the subprime mortgage crisis. Something
        about tangible effects of global warming, Covid-19, and the second
        election of Donald Trump fully curdled what was left of American
        exceptionalism. The current cultural and political temperature is grim.
        Those grunge-listening, Seinfeld-watching slackers of the 90s thought
        they were cynical, but they were merely sarcastic. Americans are really
        cynical now, and the movies reflect it. Most movies are escapist
        superhero stories dislodged from reality, horrors, or uninteresting,
        made-by-committee sequels or remakes. Hollywood is not taking any
        chances because the industry, like American empire, is in decline.
      </p>
      <p>
        The crises of the present make nostalgia alluring to the escapist. The
        past was long enough ago to begin to understand it. What, exactly, were
        the 90’s? Or, what do the movies say they were? The messages of high
        concept 90’s movies were not coherent, singularly or collectively. There
        is no uniformity to them. There is a diversity of studios, directors,
        screenwriters, actors and producers of the most culturally impactful
        films of the decade. Still, there are some trends that capture what the
        90’s mean, looking back. Below are discussions of one film from each
        year in the 90’s that was one of the top twenty highest grossing movies
        domestically in their respective years. I chose the films somewhat
        randomly. Some I love. Some I do not. Some I saw in the 90’s. Some I
        watched for the first time when doing research. Some are earnest and
        optimistic. Others are dark and pessimistic. For the most part, they are
        not cynical (with one glaring exception I will discuss later). In the
        90’s, high concept films were not as cynical as they would become after
        the turn of century (à la 28 Weeks Later, Avatar, How to Lose a Guy in
        Ten Days). 90’s high concept films may not all have the childlike
        earnestness of a Stephen Spielberg flick, but even the dark and gritty
        ones self-consciously seek to tell a story about universal human
        experiences. 90’s high concept films tend to wink at the knowing
        audience, communicating an awareness by the filmmakers and the audience
        that the movie is just a movie. Metanarrative commentary within the
        story about the story does not entail cynicism. 90’s high concept films
        knowingly tell lies the audience knows to be lies, but they are lies we
        want to believe in order to believe we are part of a society that works.
        90’s high concept movies attempt the power of myth by tapping into the
        universal, while self-consciously commenting on their own construction.
        90’s films attempt coherence and are full of contradictions. In order to
        understand whether the concept of America was coherent in the 90’s, it
        is instructive to look at what some movies said about America back then.
      </p>
      <p>1990: Pretty Woman</p>
      <p>
        Most people associate high concept films with big budget sci-fi or
        adventure films, but the romantic comedy Pretty Woman, the second
        highest grossing film of 1990, is certainly high concept. Initially,
        screenwriter J. F. Lawton conceived of Pretty Woman as a melodrama about
        the dangers of prostitution in Los Angeles. With studio and directorial
        interference, it became a Cinderella story about a businessman (Richard
        Gere) who hires a sex worker (Julia Roberts) to be his date for a week,
        and eventually falls in love. Richard Gere seemingly has only
        transactional relationships with women, and rejects them when they
        impose their wants and desires. At the beginning of the film, after a
        phone call breakup with an unseen disgruntled ex, he opts for a purely
        transactional relationship with Julia Roberts to make his relations with
        women as simple as possible. Julia Roberts is many things in Pretty
        Woman. She is assertive and self-possessed in some scenes, soft and
        girlish in others. Towards the end of the movie, when Gere offers a
        long-term paid arrangement with Roberts, she proves her virtue by
        rejecting the arrangement. She wants love. She also wants more than a
        life of prostitution and hints that she may pursue higher education.
        When the two finally decide to have a loving relationship, the film is
        touching despite its preposterousness. This is mostly due to Julia
        Roberts, who announces her star power and dominance over the film
        industry in the coming decade with her performance in Pretty Woman.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pretty Woman asks whether love is possible between a rich man and a poor
        woman, and answers, “yes.” The film slightly cringes at, but mostly
        celebrates capitalism. A subplot of the movie involves Richard Gere, a
        corporate raider, choosing not to buy and sell off a family business.
        The love of Julia Roberts inspires him to be a benevolent capitalist,
        for once. Love humanizes the capitalist. Roberts, in turn, achieves
        self-actualization by shopping. After a humiliating scene in which
        snobbish store clerks in an upscale boutique kick Julia Roberts out
        their store for being visibly working-class, Richard Gere rescues
        Roberts by financing a spending spree. This is the most iconic scene in
        the movie. Roy Orbison’s “Oh, Pretty Woman” plays as Roberts buys a ball
        gown, a cocktail dress, a polka dot dress, etc. The camera lavishes love
        on Roberts. The outfits look great. She looks great. Julia Roberts’
        character gains self-confidence by purchasing expensive outfits. The sex
        worker becomes a lady, and Julia Roberts too transforms from a promising
        young actor into the most important actress of the 90’s.
      </p>
      <p>
        The criticisms of Pretty Woman are readily available with some thought.
        A film that celebrates wealth also celebrates the economic conditions
        that trapped Julia Roberts in the first place. The film seems to both
        glamorize prostitution and condemn it as a personal choice of profession
        made by women who are not self-actualized and goal-oriented. In
        addition, the overall message that non-transactional love can exist
        between the rich and the poor is incoherent. Let’s say Roberts marries
        Gere. Their relationship is still transactional because Gere is the
        income earner. It is hard to envision any relationship in a capitalist
        system that does not involve money. And, of course, there is no way
        Roberts and Gere last more than a year or two.
      </p>
      <p>
        No one really believes in the love story of Pretty Woman, as compelling
        as it is. The movie itself does not believe in the love story. In one
        scene, Julia Roberts, despondent about whether love is possible, asks
        her roommate, played by Laura San Giacomo, whether love ever worked out
        for anyone. Giacomo responds, “Cinderella,” and the two laugh. The
        characters in the movie explicitly discuss the implausibility of the
        narrative they are in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further metacommentary on the unreality of the of the story of Pretty
        Woman is in the final moment of the film, just before credits roll. The
        camera pans to a black man called “The Afro-American” in the screenplay.
        He says, “Welcome to Hollywood. What's your dream? Everybody comes here.
        This is Hollywood, the land of dreams. Some dreams come true, some
        don't. But keep on dreaming. This is Hollywood. Always time to dream, so
        keep on dreaming.” This same black man is in an early sequence of the
        film, being questioned by cops about a dead body found on the street.
        The man informs the cops that the woman was a prostitute and a crack
        addict. “The Afro-American” serves as a Greek chorus, commenting on the
        dreams of residents of Los Angeles, presenting two outcomes for sex
        workers: death by overdose and elevation by finding true love with a
        rich guy. The former is more plausible, and the movie knows it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pretty Woman is not a realistic love story and that is the whole point.
        It is similar to any other story you tell yourself to make the
        incoherent cohere. Of course, money does not guarantee love and
        happiness, but money is nice to have. Of course, corporate raiders are
        destructive forces in the global economy, but it might be nice to date
        one of them. Of course, dresses do not constitute self-actualization,
        but they are pretty. Working class people with dreams of freedom from
        the tyranny of rent and debt have to hold contradictions within
        themselves in order to tolerate their condition. The movies express
        those contradictions.
      </p>
      <p>1991: Silence of the Lambs</p>

      <p>
        Like Pretty Woman of the former year, 1991’s Silence of the Lambs uses a
        high concept formula to discuss gender relations in the late twentieth
        century. Silence of the Lambs was a commercial and critical hit and is
        considered a classic, but it provoked controversy at the time of its
        release. LGBTQ and feminist activists justifiably decried the movie’s
        depiction of gay and trans folks. Silence of the Lambs is a
        psychological horror thriller about an FBI trainee who seeks help from a
        cannibal serial killer in order to find out the identity of another
        serial killer. The serial killer the movie makes you like is Hannibal
        Lecter, played by Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins is a brilliant psychiatrist
        with upper-class affect and tastes. The bad serial killer, Buffalo Bill,
        played by Ted Levine, reads as blue collar and is coded as trans.
        Buffalo Bill is male presenting, has sex with men, and kidnaps fat women
        in order to sew their skin into a suit that transforms him into the
        person he wants to be. The movie, and the novel it is based on, lack the
        courage of their convictions and stop short of stating that Buffalo Bill
        is trans. Hannibal Lecter explicitly states that Bill is “not really
        trans,” and, instead, has a “pathology a thousand times more savage.” He
        is a self-hating gay man who imagines he wants to transform into
        something he is not. The protagonist FBI trainee in the film, Clarice
        Starling (Jodie Foster), agrees with Lecter, stating, “There’s no
        correlation in literature between transsexualism and violence.
        Transsexuals are very passive.” The movie knows it appears to be
        transphobic and tries to get ahead of the issue with a throwaway line
        that is contradicted by all of the transphobic imagery and content that
        audiences readily pick up on. The movie views Buffalo Bill’s condition,
        something akin to but apart from “transsexualism,” as a metaphorical
        expression of self-hatred and a desire to escape, fueled by childhood
        trauma. Buffalo Bill makes the metaphor blunt by implanting moth cocoons
        into his dead victims, the moths symbolizing metamorphosis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Silence’s paranoia about gender relations extends beyond the existence
        of trans people. In more subtle ways, the film expresses paranoia about
        whether women can succeed in male dominated professions. In Silence,
        Clarice Starling is always the smartest person in the room, except when
        Lecter is present. Yet her male superiors and coworkers constantly
        undermine her. Her boss intentionally withholds information from her,
        she is excluded from discussions of sex crimes because she is a woman,
        and colleagues inappropriately hit on her. Starling ultimately defeats
        the patriarchy. She uses information gained from Lecter and her
        detective skills to catch and kill Buffalo Bill on her own, while the
        male FBI agents fumble the case. Starling is the rare American to
        succeed at rising in class status. She graduates from the FBI Academy
        and, presumably, starts an illustrious career. The film comments
        explicitly on the theme of Clarice’s upward mobility. Lecter, an expert
        reader of people, ferrets out the West Virginian rural accent that she
        tries to suppress. He notes the cheapness of her clothing. He ascertains
        she wants to rise in society by joining the FBI. Clarice is smart and
        determined enough to overcome gender and class barriers. Cis gender
        Clarice achieves social mobility by killing a trans threat. The film
        resolves fear about women in the workplace by reinforcing paranoia about
        the queers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Silence both reinforces paranoia about trans people and serial killers,
        and provides a palliative for this paranoia: faith in expertise. Lecter
        is a psychiatrist, so he is able to get into the mind of Buffalo Bill.
        Clarice Starling too is an A student at the FBI Academy, with training
        in behavioral sciences. Starling and Lecter’s expertise enable them to
        understand Buffalo Bill. As for audiences who have no expertise, simple
        visual metaphors, like the insertion of moths into corpses, make
        transsexual serial killers legible to the movie watcher. If you
        understand the blunt visual metaphor, you understand the killer. Silence
        further democratizes expertise with the riddles Lecter speaks in. He
        uses anagrams to distract the stupid male FBI agents and secretly
        provide information to Clarice and the audience. Alongside Clarice, the
        audience feels good about solving a simple word puzzle. The mystery of
        trans people is solvable with visual imagery, psychological expertise
        and anagrams.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jonathan Demme, the director of Silence of the Lambs, was a humanistic
        director and Silence is an earnest movie. Demme strove to convert the
        dark source material of the original novel into a movie as positive and
        life-affirming as a serial killer story can be. Silence is a feminist
        movie, sort of. The movie encourages audiences to root for a smart,
        capable young woman battling against male authority figures and serial
        killers, and succeeding. Jodie Foster’s nuanced performance is layered.
        She speaks with her eyes. She notices men noticing and undermining her,
        and does not say anything, until she occasionally does, politely, of
        course. She is vulnerable and resilient all at once. She is soft and
        feminine and analytical and tough. She absorbs all of the ill will of
        the men around her into herself while remaining virtuous and
        achievement-oriented. She is a prototype for other tough women in
        male-dominated fields to come later in film and on tv (e.g. Dana Scully
        in The X-Files).
      </p>
      <p>
        The logic of the feminism of Silence of the Lambs is the general logic
        of liberation espoused by American liberals. As bell hooks once noted,
        liberals, every once in a while, choose a minority group – a flavor of
        the month – to pretend to support. Liberals can only support so many
        groups at once. Others have to wait their turn. In the liberal
        conception of American progress, the bounty of American freedom will
        eventually be shared by all social groups, but progress cannot happen
        all at once. Progress is gradual, and managed by the Democratic Party.
        Any regressions in freedom are due to the Republicans, or the leftists
        who refuse to vote for Democrats. Clarice’s feminist rise is occasioned
        by the denigration of trans people. Trans liberation will come later. Or
        not.
      </p>
      <p>
        High concept films have an uneasy relationship with minorities. They
        tend to have straightforward protagonists and antagonists. Even a
        humanistic high concept film only humanizes the protagonist and
        otherizes the antagonist. The interpretation of Silence that I have
        offered so far is it humanizes the career woman by dehumanizing the
        trans person. Another interpretation is the movie is just a movie, and
        Buffalo Bill is an absurd creature of fiction. The film winks and nods
        at the audience, insisting that Bill is not really trans, which is true.
        The woman suit and the moth symbolism are details that can only exist in
        a movie or pulp novel. This is the nature of movies. They blend realism
        with genre tropes. Mapping the ideas of a movie onto reality is not
        always straightforward, and viewers can have their own interpretations.
        Still, whether Silence is transphobic or not (I say it is), it portrays
        society as filled with dark and sinister men. A virtuous woman’s ability
        to defeat dark forces is tied to violence. Clarice Starling pulls the
        trigger and kills a man in the end, and we celebrate her for it and
        understand her to be good.
      </p>
      <p>1992: Basic Instinct</p>
      <p>
        The year after Silence of the Lambs, Basic Instinct provided LGBT
        activist groups another movie to protest. Basic Instinct is an erotic
        thriller about a cop who falls for a crime novelist he suspects is
        guilty of murder. The crime novelist femme fatale, played by Sharon
        Stone, is bisexual, sparking the criticism that the film reinforces the
        notion that bisexuals are sinister. Joe Eszterhas wrote the screenplay
        for Basic Instinct, iterating on erotic thrillers of the 80’s, such as
        his own screenplay for Jagged Edge (1985), as well as Fatal Attraction
        (1987) and Sea of Love (1989). In addition, the film references
        Hitchcock paranoid thrillers, such as Vertigo (1958) and Psycho (1960).
        These references are important because Basic Instinct is very much a
        movie based on movies that exists in movieland. Every aspect of Basic
        Instinct is cartoonishly outsized. Sharon Stone is not a person. She is
        an icy blonde who controls men with sex and also kills them. She
        dominates every scene she is in, and every man or lesbian she is around.
        Michael Douglas is also cartoonish. He is the epitome of a bad cop. He
        shoots four civilians in five years. He is a recovering alcohol and
        cocaine addict. He sleeps with the police psychologist (Jeanne
        Tripplehorn) assigned to his case, and, in one scene, date rapes her. He
        eventually kills Jeanne Tripplehorn, mistakenly assuming that when she
        reaches for her keys, she is reaching for her gun. The film suggests
        Sharon Stone frames Tripplehorn for the murder Stone committed, and
        Douglas readily accepts this obvious frame-up of Tripplehorn by Stone.
        After killing his psychologist and former fling, Douglas happily resumes
        having sex with Sharon Stone, while Stone, in turn, contemplates killing
        him. Basic Instinct is absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
        The message of Basic Instinct seems to be that sex is dangerous and men
        are stupid and driven by sex. The movie communicates this message as
        bluntly as possible. Whereas Hitchcock films hint at sex with
        suggestion, Basic Instinct has full frontal male and female nudity.
        Whereas characters of erotic thrillers in the 80’s are plausibly human,
        Sharon Stone is a comic book villain. This is by design. Stone’s
        performance is brilliant and correctly tuned to the bluntness of
        director Paul Verhoeven’s take on the erotic thriller.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to author and critic Karina Longworth, Basic Instinct is the
        culmination of the erotic thrillers that preceded it, and the last movie
        of the genre to impact mainstream culture. I suspect that there is a
        limit to the amount of high concept twisted romances possible. Stone and
        Douglas are so archetypal in Basic Instinct that they make any
        imitations lousy by comparison, especially Stone. There are many low
        concept twisted romances possible. My theory is that there is an
        infinity of great low concept movies possible, and a countable number of
        great high concept films possible. Basic Instinct reached the pinnacle
        of what the erotic thriller could achieve with characters so abstract,
        they are barely human. There is nowhere else to go from this peak of
        abstraction except down lower to a space of specificity and low-concept.
      </p>
      <p>1993: Jurassic Park</p>

      <p>
        In her review of Jurassic Park, New York Times film critic Janet Maslin
        praised Steven Spielberg’s innovative use of cutting-edge CGI and
        practical effects to create realistic, fearsome dinosaurs, a marvel in
        1993. She stated that “‘Jurassic Park’ is a true movie milestone,
        presenting awe- and fear-inspiring sights never before seen on the
        screen… Much scarier, however, are those aspects of “Jurassic Park” that
        establish it as the overnight flagship of a brand-new entertainment
        empire. Even while capturing the imagination of its audience, this film
        lays the groundwork for the theme-park rides, sequels and souvenirs that
        insure the “Jurassic Park” experience will live on.” Jurassic Park
        satisfied one of the lucrative functions of high concept blockbusters:
        enabling endless merchandise deals. In 1993, Universal Pictures broke
        records by making licensing deals with 100 companies to make 1,000
        different products with the Jurassic Park brand. Products included
        Jurassic Park playsets, a Jurassic Park Raptor Guard Tranq Gun, Jurassic
        Park greeting cards, an official soundtrack, Jurassic Park drinking
        glasses, and a Jurassic Park sleeping bag.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jurassic Park merchandise contradicts the supposed message of the film.
        Jurassic Park is about the attempt of a billionaire to create a theme
        park featuring dinosaurs brought to life by science. The security system
        of the theme park fails and the human characters try to save their lives
        as the dinosaurs destroy the theme park. During the climax of the film,
        a T-Rex and velociraptors destroy a gift shop in Jurassic Park,
        symbolizing the peril of attempting to commodify dinosaurs. The message
        is that humans should not use science to tamper with mother nature, and
        capitalists should not commodify animals that went extinct millions of
        years ago. Universal Pictures missed the message and went ahead with
        copyrighting the idea of a dinosaur with the same logo for Jurassic Park
        used in the movie. The movie served as an ad for the what the movie
        discourages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jurassic Park gestures at critiquing capitalism, but holds itself back.
        In the Michael Crichton novel upon which the movie is based, the
        billionaire who creates the park, played by Richard Attenborough in the
        movie, is unethical and awful and suffers a gruesome death. In the
        movie, Attenborough is kind and grandfatherly and survives. He is a
        flawed visionary, rather than a ruthless capitalist. This is because
        Spielberg saw himself in the character and demanded the screenplay
        soften the character for the film adaptation. Due to its mixed messaging
        and simplistic plot, Jurassic Park is more spectacle than story. It is a
        spectacle designed to generate profits, and the spectacle works. The
        movie proceeds at a clip and looks great. People paid to see it and
        purchased the merchandise. The special effects hold up, for the most
        part, thirty years later. Jurassic Park is a good movie, but the film is
        unusually cynical for Stephen Spielberg, a typically earnest filmmaker.

      <p>1994: The Mask</p>

      <p>
        Several months after Ace Ventura: Pet Detective introduced moviegoers to
        Jim Carrey, The Mask confirmed his star power and propelled his
        remarkable string of hits in the 90’s. The Mask is about a
        mild-mannered, unlucky in love bank teller who finds a wooden mask that,
        when put on, transforms him into a powerful, Norse god prankster with
        womanizing tendencies. The Mask is mostly a showcase for Carrey’s manic
        comedic style, but there is some plotting. The Mask contains a love
        story, sort of. Carrey falls in love Cameron Diaz (in her screen debut)
        the second she walks into his bank. Unbeknownst to Carrey, Diaz secretly
        takes pictures of the bank’s layout for her gangster boyfriend while she
        distracts Carrey with her cleavage. Carrey decides to pursue Diaz, but
        not as himself. He uses the mask to feel confident enough to date Diaz.
        Eventually, Carrey becomes confident as his real self without the mask,
        and Diaz unconvincingly falls in love with the real Carrey. The message
        is nice-guy Carrey was always enough to deserve blonde bombshell Diaz.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Mask is not a great a movie. Most high concept films, even in the
        90’s, are not winners. Though it is not great, The Mask is powerful. Or,
        at least, it is part of a long list of movies and television shows that
        promote a myth that has real-world consequences. Films such as The Mask,
        There’s Something About Mary (1998), American Pie (1999), and Notting
        Hill (1999) promote the myth that mediocre men deserve hot partners with
        whom they have nothing in common. In The Mask, Jim Carrey evolves from a
        meek man to confident one by integrating his inner pervert with his
        everyday-self such that he no longer needs a mask to pursue Cameron
        Diaz. His relationship with Diaz turns out to have very little to do
        with Diaz at all. The Mask does not have the best message. It is not
        cynical. It is just lazy and irresponsible.
      </p>
      <p>1995: Seven</p>
      <p>
        Like Silence of the Lambs, Seven presents a pessimistic vision of a
        decadent society in which serial killers represent the rottenest part.
        Also, like Silence of the Lambs, Seven suggests the expertise of
        professionals is the best defense against social decay. The brilliantly
        simple premise of Seven is a serial killer commits a series of murders
        in which each victim is guilty of one of the seven deadly sins. Two
        detectives (Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt) race to find the serial killer
        before the body count reaches seven. Morgan Freeman plays an older,
        savvier, cynical detective on the brink of retirement and Brad Pitt
        plays a young, idealistic detective. Freeman is highly intelligent and
        catches on to the pattern of the murders matching the seven deadly sins.
        Morgan’s expertise is in policework. He is also a user of libraries and
        a reader of books. In order to understand the worldview of the serial
        killer, he reads The Canterbury Tales, Dante’s Inferno, and The Merchant
        of Venice. Brad Pitt is relatively dumb and so reads the Cliff Notes.
        This is why the serial killer ultimately defeats Pitt: the killer is
        smart and Pitt is outmatched. At the climax of the film, the serial
        killer (Kevin Spacey) orchestrates a scenario in which Pitt finds out
        Spacey decapitated his wife (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Pitt retaliates by
        killing Spacey, which is what Spacey wanted. This completes the seven
        sins: Pitt is guilty of wrath and Spacey is guilty of envy.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a scene in the middle of Seven in which Freeman and Pitt
        discuss their worldviews. Freeman makes a number of cynical statements
        about the moral decay of the unnamed, rainy city in which the two men
        serve as police. Freeman first argues that since the serial killer is a
        man and not the devil, stopping one killer is not a solution to urban
        blight. Freeman transitions from discussing an extraordinary serial
        killer to discussing ordinary people in the city who are on crack and do
        not take care of their children and “just want to keep playing the
        lottery and eating hamburgers.” Pitt, the romantic idealist, is
        inarticulate, but he manages to formulate a counterargument to Freeman’s
        seeming cynicism. Pitt points out that Freeman has remained on the force
        for many years. Pitt is not a genius, but he is right. Pitt knows that
        Freeman’s seeming cynicism is a mask for his disappointed humanism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Much like the character Freeman plays, Seven appears to be cynical, but
        it is not. The movie has a dark ending, but it is satisfying to watch
        Pitt complete the seventh sin and ruin his life and career. Narratively,
        this is the best ending possible. Seven presents a puzzle, and resolves
        it. The film is pessimistic about urban blight, and optimistic about the
        capacity of expertise to, if not totally erase, at least explicate the
        problems of modernity. Pitt suffers the most because his idealism is
        unbacked by intelligence. Freeman appears cynical, but he is an idealist
        at heart. The serial killer does not manage to destroy Freeman because
        he is the smart one. Freeman witnesses suffering in his city and so he
        is a pessimist. He is a lonely, unmarried social outcast. But, like
        Clarice Starling, he is the embodiment of expertise that protects and
        justifies the project of modernity.
      </p>
      <p>1996: The Nutty Professor</p>
      <p>
        The 1996 remake of The Nutty Professor, like The Mask, is a Jekyll and
        Hyde story. 1963’s Nutty Professor stars Jerry Lewis, a dorky professor
        who develops a potion that turns him into a womanizing jerk. The remake
        has the same premise, but adds blackness and fatness to the equation.
        The remake stars Eddie Murphy in a fat suit as a black, dorky professor
        who develops a potion that turns him into a thin, womanizing jerk. The
        message of The Nutty Professor is obvious from the outset: fat Eddie
        Murphy is kind and more deserving of love than mean, skinny Eddie
        Murphy. The film says this explicitly, and contradicts this implicitly.
        Most of the movie makes fun of fat Eddie Murphy. He erases chalk boards
        by accident with his belly, he breaks a treadmill, chairs creak under
        the pressure of his weight, etc. In addition to making fun of him, the
        movie also humanizes fat Eddie Murphy. Eddie Murphy, the actor in the
        suit, is great at capturing the graciousness and apologies for existing
        that many fat people exhibit in reality. The Nutty Professor is thus at
        cross purposes with itself. It is sensitive to the plight of fat people
        while making fun of them. Despite mixed messaging, The Nutty Professor
        is way ahead of most Hollywood films which pretend that fat people do
        not even exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Nutty Professor is self-aware about being a movie. It explicitly
        comments on how media informs anti-fatness. Murphy watches a
        Richard-Simmons-like weight loss guru (also played by Eddie Murphy) on
        television and feels bad about himself. Murphy’s character is inundated
        with media. Murphy envisions himself in the movies and shows he watches.
        In one scene, he sees himself make out with his love interest (Jaida
        Pinkett Smith) on a beach, crushing and pushing Pinkett beneath him into
        the sand in a parody of the iconic beach make-out in From Here to
        Eternity. The Nutty Professor is well aware of the mental illnesses and
        eating disorders popular media encouraged in the 90’s and the movie is
        aware it has a responsibility to combat anti-fatness with a message of
        self-acceptance. The movie simultaneously contributes new iconography to
        anti-fat culture. The imagery of the film, the transformations of skinny
        Murphy into fat Murphy, is anti-fat. When parts of skinny Murphy’s body
        swell into globules of fat, the imagery evokes the notion that inside
        every fat person is a thin one.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Nutty Professor has some compassion for fat black men, and none for
        fat black women. Murphy learns to accept himself, but his love interest,
        Jaida Pinkett, is thin and conventionally attractive. Jaida Pinkett is
        also a light-skinned black woman with hazel eyes, which is the preferred
        type of black woman in media. Pinkett tends to keep her hair short in
        reality, so the hairstylist for the film plopped a wig on Pinkett,
        further conforming the love interest to a narrow beauty standard. The
        Nutty Professor is similar to The Mask. It encourages self-acceptance
        for men and men only.
      </p>
      <p>
        The genius of The Nutty Professor is Eddie Murphy does not just play the
        skinny and fat versions of himself. He plays his whole family in a
        joyous scene in which Murphy, the professor, has dinner with his mother,
        father, brother and grandfather, all played by Murphy in makeup. We see
        in this scene that the professor comes from a family of big black people
        who love eating and have access to black joyfulness. Murphy’s family,
        the Klumps, have big black bodies that cinema tends not to associate
        with wealth in the manner that cinema associates wealth with thinness
        and whiteness. The scene of the Klumps laughing and eating is the most
        humanizing scene in the movie. The issue is, it humanizes Eddie Murphy
        the actor, not black people as a whole, because Murphy is the man under
        the makeup. Murphy required this humanization at the time because, prior
        to The Nutty Professor, he had a string of critical and commercial
        flops, and a diminished reputation in the press. Film critic Owen
        Gleiberman’s review of The Nutty Professor for Entertainment Weekly is
        somewhat racist and fat-phobic, but it demonstrates what dire need
        Murphy had for a comeback in 1996. Of Murphy’s fall from grace,
        Gleiberman writes “His arrogance mutated into a contempt for comedy, for
        entertainment, for stardom itself. By the time the ’90s rolled around,
        he had turned into a steroid parody of himself.” Gleiberman praises
        Murphy for returning to entertainment “a humbled man” in a fat suit. He
        states that Murphy “rediscover[s] his joy as a performer. He rediscovers
        it, too, as Sherman Klump, a fellow who, much like Murphy, is on the
        bottom rung, desperate to reinvent himself, and — at long last — does.”
        Gleiberman review is outlandish but true. Murphy reinvigorated his
        career by wearing a fat suit. Murphy followed the playbook many
        beautiful, thin, elite actors follow: play a marginalized person. Movies
        about marginalized people somewhat humanize marginalized people, while
        also reinforcing their marginalization. By contrast, movies about
        marginalized people most effectively humanize the thin, beautiful actor
        under the makeup. The Nutty Professor is, thus, a little cynical, but it
        has one of very few somewhat positive depictions of fat blackness in
        90’s cinema. The movie tries to be kind, to an extent.
      </p>
      <p>1997: Titanic</p>
      <p>
        Titanic is one of the greatest spectacles of the 90’s, in or outside of
        cinema. The hook for the film is a realistic recreation of the
        historical sinking of an ocean liner in 1912. The disaster constitutes
        the second half of the film. The first half is a romance between a young
        woman of status and a poor boy. The technological marvel of the
        recreation of the Titanic and the simple earnestness of the first-love
        story mutually reinforce each other to create maximum effect. Writer and
        director James Cameron structured the movie brilliantly. It opens with a
        modern-day vessel exploring the wreckage of the Titanic. The audience
        sees ghostly relics, like a porcelain doll head and rusty chandeliers.
        The images suggest that what is about happen in the movie really did
        happen. Though the love story of Rose (Kate Winslet) and Jack (Leonardo
        DiCaprio) is fictional, the real historical background and the framing
        of the movie lend the love story weight. The technological authenticity,
        historical accuracy, and the framing of Titanic imbue the story with the
        aura of universality. The story of Rose is meant to stand in for the
        story of any young woman seeking both love and independence. Titanic,
        much like Pretty Woman, asks how can women live spiritually fulfilled
        lives when limited by patriarchy and income inequality. Since Titanic
        cannot help but be capitalistic in function and messaging, the answers
        it offers are as contradictory as the messaging of any high concept
        movie. The sugar of the movie helps the ideology go down. Titanic is a
        really effective movie.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rose’s journey is simple and profound. Her formerly rich family has
        fallen on hard times, so her mother arranges for her to marry the
        wealthy Billy Zane. Rose has intellectual and artistic yearnings, and no
        way to fulfill them within high society. Jack is a free-spirited
        working-class artist. He introduces Rose to working-class joy and to
        sex. Loving Jack frees Rose of her bonds with her manipulative mother
        and her sociopath fiancé. She no longer desires to be a member of high
        society. Jack helps Rose achieve self-actualization, and so, for
        narrative purposes, he dies at the end of the movie. Rose lets his body
        fall into the ocean amongst the wreckage and corpses of the Titanic. A
        boat rescues her and she arrives in America. Rose stands under the
        Statue of Liberty and it becomes clear that the movie was an American
        nationalist movie all along. Despite that the historical Titanic was a
        British ocean liner and despite most passengers being British, the movie
        focuses on Americans and tells an American tale. The film suggests that
        the life Rose lives in the United States, after fleeing high society, is
        full of adventure and love. The film suggests that independence and
        fulfillment are possible in the States.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the best and worst aspects of Titanic is its depiction of
        class-stratification. The film characterizes many of the first-class
        patrons on the upper decks as snobs. Rose’s mother is mean and her
        fiancé is a murderous sociopath. By contrast, the poor passengers and
        workers on the lower decks are all easygoing and likable. One sequence
        of the film contrasts a boring, snobbish dinner party of aristocrats
        with a fun dance party of working-class people. In order to tell simple
        narratives with simple morals, like wealth does not guarantee
        fulfillment, high concept films tend to resort to reductive binaries,
        like rich people are boring and poor people are cool. The notion that
        poor people have more fun than rich people is not particularly
        anticapitalist. It is actually condescending. Titanic gestures at a
        critique of capitalism, but only superficially. The film champions
        Rose’s descent from high status to middle-classness as a virtuous
        all-American journey of self-discovery. Money does not mean everything,
        the film says. But, then again, money is important. The film cost $200
        million to make, the highest budget of any movie at the time of its
        production. It grossed $2.2 billion, and was the highest grossing movie
        of all time, not adjusting for inflation, until another James Cameron
        movie, Avatar, surpassed it in 2009. Expensive spectacles like Titanic
        are celebrations of what commercial art can do when the vision is as
        large as the budget. Titanic is expensive and spectacular. It shows the
        audience what it is like to be a rich girl on a luxury ocean liner. The
        film is a celebration of wealth and excess, with a nationalistic message
        about how great it is to be a middle-class American.
      </p>
      <p>
        Titanic is the most earnest of the films discussed so far. It earnestly
        preaches what Jack Dawson preaches to Rose: seize the day and live your
        best life. This is great advice when divorced from context. How do you
        live your best life when almost all dry land is private property and
        rent is expensive and most jobs are bad jobs? How do you seize the day
        if you are disposed to depression?
      </p>
      <p>
        Rose’s story is inspirational, but not universal. The film may make you
        think her story is universal, and that is a trick. The film uses nested
        story structure to pull off the trick. The movie knows that it is a
        movie, so, in order to make the story more real, it nests the story of
        Rose within a real story of a historical disaster, and nests that story
        within a story of modern-day skeptics exploring the wreckage. Modern-day
        old Rose reminds the skeptical scientists that love and fulfillment are
        possible in the land of opportunity, and skeptical audiences are
        supposed to feel the same, if the trick of the movie works.
      </p>
      <p>1998: Truman Show</p>
      <p>
        The Truman Show is one of those “reality is not what you think it is”
        high concept classics of the 90’s, like The Matrix (1999) and Fight Club
        (1999). The premise is the character Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is the
        unknowing star of a reality television show, living on a massive
        soundstage, surrounded by cast and crew. In the show of his life, he has
        an ordinary desk job as an insurance salesman, and a house like all of
        the houses on his block. The architecture, cars and clothing in the
        movie evoke the 1950’s in order to further the movie’s critique of
        suburban rot.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most self-referential moment of The Truman Show, a very meta movie,
        occurs just before the credits roll. The show within the movie has an
        unexpected series finale when Truman figures out the falseness of his
        reality, and exits the soundstage. The show ends and a cop shown
        watching the show with another cop says, “what else is on?” Then the
        credits roll. The Truman Show, among other things, is a critique of
        media while being a part of the media machine it critiques. The movie
        knows it itself produces the delusion fuel that encourages Americans to
        hallucinate reality. The cops at the end of the movie finish watching an
        unethical television program, and uncritically look for some other
        distraction. The Truman Show critiques mass media, but with a knowing
        wink. The movie knows its audience is just going to go watch something
        else afterwards.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Truman Show encourages people to reject the narrow parameters of a
        mediocre life, and to pursue their dreams. There is danger in this
        notion because the real-life analogue of Truman is a crazy person. If
        the character of Truman is not really in a television show, then he is a
        boring man experiencing a mid-life crisis who is abusive to his wife,
        harbors a decades long infatuation for a pretty woman he flirted with
        once in high school, and imagines that the entire world is about him.
        Truman has a nice, boring job, and a nice, boring wife and a nice,
        boring life. For a working-class person, things could be worse. Boring
        people in boring suburbs had best not have psychotic breaks like Truman.
        Instead, just find out what else is on. The Truman Show is pretty good.
      </p>
      <p>1999: The Matrix</p>
      <p>
        The Matrix is very similar to The Truman Show, except it is more iconic
        because it takes better advantage of what the movies can do. The Matrix
        is The Truman Show with better costumes, amazing action and stunts,
        groundbreaking CGI and an iconic score. The premise is Neo (Keanu
        Reeves) is a software engineer who learns that reality as we know it is
        a computer program called the Matrix. Artificial Intelligence machines
        designed the Matrix to hypnotize humans as their bodies are harvested
        for energy. Due to similar unreality-of-reality worldbuilding, the
        messages and implications of The Matrix are similar to those of The
        Truman Show. In The Truman Show, the show-creator asks Truman whether he
        would like to return to a peaceful life in the fake world of the show,
        or risk living in the real world. In The Matrix, Morpheus (Laurence
        Fishburne) asks Neo whether he will take the blue pill and return to the
        comfort of the fake world of the Matrix, or take red pill and face the
        perilous life of the rebels. Truman and Neo choose reality over
        illusion. They choose to be rebels and non-conformists. The Truman Show
        is paranoid about the ability of television to warp reality and pacify
        the masses. The Matrix is paranoid about the ability of computers to
        warp reality and pacify the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Audiences on the political left and right have all claimed The Matrix as
        symbolic of their ideology. Some leftists interpret the rebels as
        symbolic of anticapitalistic revolutionaries. Others interpret the
        red-pill-blue-pill choice as representative of hormone replacement
        therapy for trans people. The Wachowski sisters, who wrote and directed
        the film, came out as trans years after the release of The Matrix, and
        have suggested that trans identity was likely in the back of their minds
        when penning the script. The Wachowski sisters are on the left but,
        against their will, the alt-right has coopted the red pill to symbolize
        rejecting feminism and liberalism, and waking up to the reality of the
        superiority of white men. The Matrix has some of the most memorable
        images of any high concept film. Those powerful images are abstract and
        thus variously interpretable.

        Even in the hands of leftists like the Wachowski sisters, high concept
        films have difficulty conveying radical messages. Most mainstream
        American movies have main characters. The main character of The Matrix,
        Neo, becomes an all-powerful, Jesus-like figure by the end of the movie.
        The one-true-savior trope is not particularly compatible with a
        collectivist understanding of political struggle, so the Wachowskis
        tried to correct the main character problem of The Matrix in its
        sequels. The sequels adjust the world-building of the original in order
        to contradict conservative interpretations of The Matrix, but the
        sequels are less good and less culturally impactful than the original.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Wachowskis are humanists, yet The Matrix is violent. At the climax
        of the film, Neo and his love interest Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) shoot
        and kill dozens of security guards. These guards are ordinary people who
        are controlled by the Matrix. Weapons and martial arts are hooks that
        make The Matrix iconic. Main characters with guns are common tools of
        the high concept film. These tools contradict the concepts of
        egalitarianism and nonviolence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Filmmaking has many perils for the leftist. The worldbuilding of The
        Matrix has implications that the Wachowskis probably did not intend. The
        worldbuilding, unintentionally, I think, naturalizes capitalism. In one
        expository scene, the antagonist of the film, Agent Smith (Hugo
        Weaving), explains to Neo that early versions of the Matrix had
        egalitarian societies, leading people to wake up from the Matrix because
        they expect society to be hierarchical and full of suffering. It is
        difficult, even for leftists, to imagine that the suffering incurred by
        capitalism is not fundamental to human life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Matrix is about some notion of freedom, and the kind of freedom it
        espouses is contestable. The movie is powerful because it is an abstract
        allegory, and because its meaning is contestable. It uses common
        elements of effective filmmaking like main characters, violence, and
        memorable images to captivate audiences. The Wachowskis probably
        intended a leftist interpretation, but the core elements of high concept
        filmmaking work against the intentions of the filmmakers. There is
        something narcissistic about main characters. There is something
        sociopathic about celebrating main characters when they kill the “bad
        guys” without remorse. Perhaps there is something to all this
        overanalysis of a really fun movie. Or perhaps the movie can just be a
        movie.

      <p>Looking Forward</p>
      <p>
        The high concept films discussed in this essay say many things. They say
        that interclass romance is possible, every guy is enough for a hot girl,
        prosperity and fulfilment are possible for middle class Americans, men
        are driven by sex, fat black men deserve love, expertise can help
        protect modern societies from violence, people should live their best
        lives by rejecting conformity, too much media consumption is bad for
        you, and women can succeed in male-dominated fields. These films
        sometimes contradict themselves and each other because they also say
        interclass romance is a fantasy, fat people do not deserve love, money
        is everything, and keep going to the movies because movies are awesome.
        These ideas may not be coherent, but they are, at least, ideas
        communicated earnestly and effectively by their respective films.
        Somewhere around the turn of the century, Hollywood seemed to run out of
        ideas. Many films of the 2000’s iterate on high concept 90’s films with
        less successful results. The Proposal (2009) iterates on Pretty Woman,
        but it is lazier and creepier. Pearl Harbor uses the disaster/romance
        formula of Titanic, but the romance is unconvincing and the nationalism
        too jingoistic. Minority Report (2002) and Inception (2010) and are
        excellent iterations on The Matrix, but it is impossible to improve upon
        The Matrix. It would take another essay to explore and explain why high
        concept films declined in the 2000’s. There are many reasons for the
        decline of high concept films that stem from institutional changes this
        essay does not touch on. The conglomeration of movie studios in the 90’s
        accelerates in the 2000’s. Digital platforms caused the death of DVD
        sales. The foreign market became increasingly important. Sequels and
        remakes displaced films with original content. In addition to all of
        these structural causes, I think there is a theoretical reason for the
        decline of high concept films. There are not that many concepts. How
        many Cinderella stories can improve on Pretty Woman? How many
        reality-bending narratives can best The Matrix?
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past couple of decades, high-concept films have become even
        more self-aware than they were in the 90’s. Self-awareness used to be
        cool. Now it is cynical. The self-awareness of The Truman Show and The
        Nutty Professor is subversive. By contrast, the self-awareness of, say,
        Deadpool & Wolverine (2024) is a cynical excuse to put ads in a movie
        without hiding it. 90’s high concept films are self-aware about
        constructing myths. 2000’s movies are self-aware about being ads.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hollywood is afraid of new ideas right now, but if high concept films
        are going to be great again, we are going to need some new concepts.
        Americans desperately need new concepts in order to reckon with the
        current particular stage of imperial decline. I do not trust that
        sequels and remakes of old intellectual property will continue to keep
        the industry afloat. At some point, audiences will demand ideas. I hope
        new ideas are possible.
