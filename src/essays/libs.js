        Libt*rds Will Not Save Ret*rds: How Liberals Exploit the Marginalized

        When I was a child, my mom played racquetball at a grassless concrete
        park in Brooklyn with a man named Winter. Winter was tall and lanky, and
        he had a remarkably ordinary face. I liked Winter because he was nice
        and he was comfortable existing in the world of children without
        condescension. Winter was different from other adults in this way and in
        others. Every word he spoke seemed to require effort and spit. He tended
        not to maintain eye contact and his expressions were vacant. The holes
        in my memory make it hard to pinpoint when, but at some point I
        understood that I should no longer play with Winter because he was the
        mean thing other kids said that is similar to and worse than stupid. I
        was learning how to shun and exclude. Winter was different and I wanted
        to fit in. I felt bad for Winter and I wanted to run from him and from
        anyone whose differences might rub off on me or mirror my own.

        Everyone was meaner in the 90’s. Back then, the R-word was not only a
        casual insult, but also a scientific category. According to 1994’s
        fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
        Disorders (DSM), mental retardation is classifiable as mild, moderate,
        severe and profound, depending on IQ. In its attempt to legitimate the
        field of psychiatry with smart stuff like math and science, the American
        Psychiatric Association medicalized an insult. In turn, public schools
        weaponized a slur against children, sorting some students into lower
        tracks of education and lower-class jobs.

        The culture has shifted over the past couple of decades. Ordinary
        working-class people increasingly seek out therapy without fear of being
        stigmatized as crazy. Mental health discourse has infiltrated casual
        conversation. Everyone is anxious and depressed. Everyone’s ex-boyfriend
        is a narcissist. Everyone’s crazy ex-girlfriend is borderline. Everyone
        has ADHD. And poor young people without health insurance use YouTube
        videos to diagnose themselves. Therapy is more popular than ever. The
        culture shifted and so did 2013’s fifth edition of the DSM. The R-word
        is not in it and therefore the text is more legitimate. There are all
        sorts of diagnoses for people who were once the R-word, just as there
        are thousands of scientific classifications for people who were once
        just “crazy.” The colloquial catch all for the R-word and other
        disabilities is “special needs.” We are nicer now. Sort of.

        In an off-the-cuff remark in 2009, former president Barack Obama
        compared his bowling to the Special Olympics. Obama later recovered the
        gaffe with an apology and a moral exhortation. "This kind of language
        needs to be a teachable moment for our country, I think," said Obama. "I
        would hope every parent that's at home this morning watching this show
        could turn to their children and say, 'This is a chance for us to
        recognize that when we talk about Special Olympics, when we talk about
        people with special needs. Let's make sure we talk about it in an
        affirming way.'" Obama first used the term “special needs” as a slur
        (self-deprecating to Obama and denigrating to the disabled), and then he
        used the very same term to call on Americans to be kind.
      </p>
      <p>
        One year after the gaffe, Obama signed Rosa’s Law, a law that replaces
        usages of “mental retardation” with “intellectual disability” in federal
        health, labor and education laws. This is good. It is better to
        stigmatize usage of the R-word than to sanction it in legal documents or
        casual conversation. The importance of words should not be minimized.
        But it is notable that a major piece of liberal legislation concerning
        marginalized people is linguistic. Liberals love a linguistic
        intervention. They require no money and nearly no effort, and they
        enable you to feel good about saying the right thing, and justified in
        shaming people for saying the wrong thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many liberals who, say, support the Special Olympics, but also
        pay for private school, piano lessons and SAT prep in order to ensure
        their kids go to better schools, get better jobs and make more money
        than less academically gifted kids and poor kids with less resources.
        Replacing a slur with a less pejorative term benefits the newly minted
        “intellectually disabled” to some extent, but the primary beneficiaries
        are the mentally able. After signing Rosa’s Law, Obama stated, “the
        story of the disability rights movement is enriched because it’s
        intertwined with the story of America’s progress. Americans with
        disabilities are Americans first and foremost, and like all Americans
        are entitled to not only full participation in our society, but also
        full opportunity in our society.” So long as liberals choose to support
        this or that marginalized group, often in ways that are linguistic and
        not material, then they can pretend that equal opportunity and an
        imagined nation state exist. Liberals use marginalized people to craft a
        story about themselves and the nation. Stories are powerful, but stories
        are stories.

        Whether they are cynically disingenuous or intellectually unsound,
        liberals are so frustrating that they make the term “libt*rd”
        tantalizing. Those two syllables mock the liberal agenda of virtue
        signaling with language alone, redeploying a slur many liberals were
        once comfortable with until they arbitrarily shifted their linguistic
        norms very recently. The problem is, however, that “libt*rd” punches
        down at people that old words and new words are actively redefining and
        reclassifying. The term “libt*rd” appeals to conservatives, radicals and
        liberal apostates alike, but I have to concede to liberals that words
        matter, and I cannot call them “libt*rds,” as much as I want to.

        The disability rights movement is not inherently liberal. It is just
        that the liberal state can only pass legislation that does not
        dramatically redistribute wealth and resources to people who are
        disabled by society. And liberals tend to reduce their activism to
        policing language. But we should be radicals, not cops. Personally, I am
        not a cop. I do not weaponize liberalism on Twitter. But I have striven
        to do well in a liberal nation. I have striven to get good grades as a
        student and good jobs as an adult. I have attended institutions that use
        people who look like me to present themselves as diverse and inclusive.
        I have attended these institutions so that I can acquire enough status
        and wealth to avoid the worst symptoms of blackness and
        working-classness prevalent in a diseased liberal nation. I am not a
        cop, but I don’t want to go to jail. I run from the cops. I ran from
        Winter.
