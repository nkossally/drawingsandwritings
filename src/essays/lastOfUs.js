        I could not finish the first episode of{" "}
        <span className="italic">The Last of Us</span> in one sitting. The show
        is an adaptation of a video game about a pandemic in which infected
        humans become zombie-like creatures. It’s riveting. For a few minutes I
        felt as if I were in a car with Pedro Pascal and his daughter, trying to
        drive to safety while planes flew only dozens of feet overhead in a
        residential neighborhood. I was with Pedro for a few minutes anyway. And
        then I watched him refuse to help anyone who wasn’t in his family. And
        then I was no longer in the story, but watching the story. I watched the
        camera technique turn a TV show into a first-person shooter. All of the
        zombies and all of society melded into pixels to be avoided or
        destroyed. I watched a familiar story unfold of one family versus
        everyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span className="italic">The Last of Us</span> made me sad, and this
        prompted me to turn it off and turn on my comfort show,{" "}
        <span className="italic">The Real Housewives of Potomac</span>. But
        witnessing Gizelle televise her twin daughters’ sixteenth birthday party
        and make it all about Gizelle made me feel even sadder. Epiphanically,
        it occurred to me that the sadness that permeates{" "}
        <span className="italic">The Real Housewives</span> is the same as the
        sadness of <span className="italic">The Last of Us</span>. Both shows
        are essentially saying the same thing. Is the edible kicking in or is{" "}
        <span className="italic">The Real Housewives of Potomac</span> exactly
        the same as a zombie apocalypse?
      </p>
      <p>
        The stories of <span className="italic">The Last of Us</span> and{" "}
        <span className="italic">The Real Housewives</span> smell the same, at
        least. As a creature of the internet, I use the medium of the web
        browser to watch both. By navigating from one tab to another, I can
        transport from a science fiction narrative about a pandemic induced by
        late capitalist excess to a hilarious comedy about late capitalist
        excess.
      </p>
      <p>
        There’s a consistent message across many stories the media tells us.
        Discussing two different mediums, television and the computer, can help
        illustrate the message. When I was a child, my family shared a
        television. I could not merely change webpages in order to watch a
        different show. I had to change the channel, and then negotiate with my
        family whether the change was acceptable. My father tended to watch
        soccer and he always got his way. My siblings and I debated between
        Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon. We would argue and physically fight for
        control of the remote. I am not lauding the days of the primacy of the
        television nor my nuclear family’s problematic dynamics, but changing
        the channel implied some sort of relation between brother, sister,
        father and mother. Changing a URL does not express such tangible
        relations between people.
      </p>
      <p>
        I see loneliness and alienation in the stories television and the
        internet tell. Between the two, the internet is far more alienating
        because it offers infinitely more possibilities to satisfy granular
        tastes and desires at all times. The difference between the two mediums
        is in the extremity of the alienation they foster. The alienation is the
        same.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to fostering alienation, the media tends to tell us that
        family, especially the nuclear family, is important. This is not a
        contradiction because loving your family can be as antisocial as much as
        it is social. I believe the Pedro Pascal character in<span> </span>
        <span className="italic">The Last of Us</span> really loves his daughter
        to the exclusion of everyone else. And I believe that even if Gizelle is
        so lonely and empty that she needs people who do not know her to know an
        idea of her, she still loves her daughters. I believe that the media
        teaches us that we are all alone and, at least, we love our daughters.
        And, perhaps, at most.
